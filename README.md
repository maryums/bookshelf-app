This web app uses the JS class as a template for creating new book objects. The user inputs book details such as title, author, read status and rating. The books are then pushed to an array and dynamically displayed on the DOM. The data is also saved to local storage and retrieved and set on reload.  
Currently: <br>
<li> add books with the status either read or unread </li>
<li>if a book is read, you can rate it from 1-5 stars </li>
<li>if a book is unread, and then the status is changed to read, you can add a star rating </li>

Ideas to implement: <br>
<li>Sort by read/unread status </li>
<li>Sort rated books by star rating </li>
<li>Change the rating on books that have already been rated </li>
